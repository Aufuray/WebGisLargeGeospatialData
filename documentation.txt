## Documentation

### February - March
* I used D3.js library to create a tree with the EcoRegion and taxonomy data.
* I added checkboxes beside each tree node and a submit button
* When the submit button was clicked, the node value for every selected checkbox was displayed in a div beside the tree.

### March
* I used the gbif_taxon data to create a JSON representation to be fed into D3.js library.
* I wrote a python script formatdata.py to remove all nodes with missing values replresented by prescence of '\N'
** Old File Line Num: 1,491,337
** New File Line Num 1,395,400
** Line Diff 95,937

* The output of the python parser was then fed as input to another python script to change to expected JSON format.
* File hierachy
 kingdom -> phylum -> class -> order -> family -> genus -> scientificName ->taxoid.

 ### April
Wrote the finalparser.py to parse the gbif data into correct tree heirachy for input into the D3.js library.
Output of this script is gbif.json
After this file is created, I zip the file and upload to my server
I use npm json-minify to remove spaces from the file hence reducing the size of the JSON file from 
93.4MB to 89.11MB

$ npm install -g json-minify
$ wget -qO- http://ofureukpebor.com/project/gbif.json | json-minify >> gbif.json
